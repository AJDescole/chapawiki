## How to quickly reach level 3 ? 

Since several months, you need to be level 3 on Chapatiz to talk in the chatrooms. Here is a tip to quickly reach that level : 

- Open the developper console ( F12 on Firefox and Google Chrome )
- Go the *console* tab
- Enter this code : 

```javascript
setInterval(function() { document.getElementsByClassName("mazo")[0].click(); }, 100);
```

- Press enter
- Enjoy. 

This snippet triggers click events on the mazo button every 100ms. So, as soon as the mazo button is available, your browser will click it for you. You don't even need to have the chapatiz window on foreground. 

You'll gain 10XP times your score at each play. Note that there is a max XP gainable per day, but it is enough to reach level 3 (about 2000XP) in a few hours.
